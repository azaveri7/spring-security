user request -> authentication filter -> authentication manager -> authentication provider -> user details service
                                                                                   ||
                                                                                   password encoder

1. end user sends req to our REST app, auth filter intercepts this request. It is 
   servlet filter class which will check if the user has authentication.
2. If not, the request is passed to auth mgr to check if the user details are valid.
3. auth mgr uses auth provider where login logic is there.
4. auth provider will use user details service to retrieve pwd.
5. passcode encoder is used to encrypt pwds and store.
6. if the details match with user details service, auth filter will 
   use authenticationSuccessHandler and stores authentication info in the user
   entity in security context.
